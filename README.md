# arabicscript
**arabicscript is a Python library of tools for Arabic script based on the Unicode standard.**

This version works for Unicode 9.0.

It is independant of font technology, and is intended for the script in general and not for any particular language. It provides utilities for querying properties of Arabic characters and manipulating Arabic-script strings. Some script-independent Unicode tools are also provided.
